\begin{cvletter}

My name is Zheng Ma and I am currently a Golomb Visiting Assistant Professor at Purdue University in the Department of Mathematics. I wish to apply for a tenure-track faculty position at School of Mathematical Sciences and Institute of Natural Sciences at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My current research interests mainly lie in the theoretical foundations and general theory of machine learning, as well as the applications of deep learning in computational physical problems. With a computational PDE background, I have worked on the model reduction of kinetic equations using deep neural networks, the theoretical understandings of machine learning by F-principle. Besides, I have also developed fast algorithms for kinetic equations and efficient schemes for uncertainty quantification. My long term research agenda is to develop efficient machine learning based methods to solve different kinds of physical problems. By building new machine-learned physical models and designing novel algorithms, I hope to solve interesting problems coming from real applications.

School of Mathematical Sciences at SJTU is a wonderful place for people doing not only mathematics but also sciences in general. The atmosphere is free and open where there are many talented young researchers and prestigious senior professors to talk and work with. This is also the place where I got my B.S. and Ph.D. and I know we have lots of excellent students. I am very eager to come back to work with my former professors and also my classmates.

I have enclosed my CV and Research Statement. I am more than willing to answer any of your questions concerning my research and I will certainly cherish the great opportunity of working with many researchers to advance my knowledge. Thank you for your consideration.
